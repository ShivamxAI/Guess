This is a game about guessing a number if the player's guessed number matches the randomly computer generated number then you won.
To make it more Interesting and challenging I have added two modes in the game.
1.Open game(Normal mode):
In this mode you can guess the number unlimited times.

Levels game:
In this mode there are three levels each level will be gonna get higher and higher.
when you won the third level you will get a hint as a reward.
Level 1:  You can guess the number upto 10 times(Attempt).

Level 2:  After winning the level 1 you move forward to level 2,In this level you can guess the number upto 7 times(Attempt).

Level 3:  After winning level 2 you move forward to level 3,In this level you can guess the number upto 4 times(Attempt).If you won ,will get the reward.
NOTE :   If you lose then you have to restart the game from level 1.
Hint:
when you get stuck in guessing a number then you can use that hint and get the range of the number.
Number of win's in level 3 will parallelly increase the number of hints.
Number of uses of hints will parallely decrease the number of hints.
